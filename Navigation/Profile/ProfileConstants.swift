            description: "These changes won’t convince anyone that The Witcher 3 is a new release in 2022. Instead, it gives CD Projekt an opportunity to revisit their greatest hit and smooth away some of the speed bumps that exist in a seven-year-old game.\nWhat this means is that new players in particular will be able to play The Witcher 3 without any of the issues that plagued players when the game was first released. But considering that even with some of the frame-rate dips and bugs, The Witcher 3 still swept several Game of the Year awards, it’s not as if these tech issues hampered the quality game underneath.",

            title: "Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio Review",
            description: "When it comes to Pinocchio, there’s arguably a surplus of movies about the mischievous puppet boy. Since Carlo Collodi’s children’s fantasy novel serial was published in a single book form in 1883, in fact, The Adventures of Pinocchio have been adapted for the silver screen 21 times. Two of which were released rather recently in live-action form: the disappointing Robert Zemeckis remake of the 1940 Disney animation and Matteo Garrone’s impressive Italian version that stuck more closely to the original source material. Now Guillermo del Toro has served up the 22nd adaptation, his passion project; an animated feature using stop-motion puppets that uses Collodi’s tale as a jumping-off point to weave in historical fact with fantastical, at times macabre fiction.",

            title: "Goat Simulator 3 Review",
            description: "I don’t know if I’ve ever played something as gobsmackingly unhinged as Goat Simulator 3. Developer Coffee Stain North’s doggedly rebellious attitude is apparent in everything from the incoherent “story” to gameplay so over-the-top that half the time it’s hard to tell what’s happening – even the title refuses to play by the rules, skipping Goat Simulator 2 and going straight to three for no particular reason. Throw in four-player co-op that multiplies the madness to even greater extremes as you run rampant through a large open-world map filled with things to lick, headbutt, and blow up, and you’ve got yourself a game so absurd it’s hard to imagine being bored for even a second. This deranged sequel is bigger, packed with silly jokes and pop culture references, and one of stupidest things I have ever beheld. It was love at first bleat.",
